# Conway's Game of Life
## Why I built the project this way
- This project is react version of Game of Life, I built this to analyze(learn) performance diff between js-wasm, js-only and react versions.
- Here are [js-wasm](https://github.com/zkindest/rust-wa-game-of-life), [js-only](https://github.com/zkindest/js-game-of-life) repos.
## Usage (coming...)
