# Conway's Game of Life
## Why I built the project this way
- This project is react version of Game of Life, which does not use canvas (although it's more performant).
- Here are [js-wasm](https://github.com/zkindest/rust-wa-game-of-life), [js-only](https://github.com/zkindest/js-game-of-life) versions which use canvas to render.
## Usage 
```sh
yarn run dev # dev
yarn run build 
yarn run preview
```
